# auto-ai-model
An automated AI/ML pipeline that trains, evaluates, and saves the best-performing machine learning models with minimal manual intervention.
Watson Machine Learning Setup Guide
This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough for setting up, training, and deploying a machine learning model using IBM Watson Machine Learning services on IBM Cloud.

Overview
This document helps users:

Set up Watson Machine Learning services

Create and manage AI projects in Watson Studio

Train a model using AutoAI

Deploy the model in a cloud environment

Run batch predictions using form inputs

Prerequisites
IBM Cloud account

Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

A prepared dataset (used for training the model)

Steps Summary
ðŸŽ¯ Service Setup
Search and open Watson Machine Learning in IBM Cloud.

Choose the same location as Watson Studio (e.g., Frankfurt or London).

Select the Free plan and agree to terms.

Launch the Watson Machine Learning service.

ðŸ§ª Create a Project & Experiment
In Watson Studio, create a new project.

Navigate to Assets > New Asset > AutoAI.

Name the experiment and associate your ML instance.

Upload the dataset and run the experiment.

ðŸ¤– Model Selection & Saving
Review the AutoAI pipelines and select the one with highest accuracy.

Save the model and promote it to a deployment space.

ðŸš€ Model Deployment
Create a new deployment space named PROJECT ATTRITION.

Associate with Watson ML and deploy the saved model as Batch.

ðŸ“Š Run Prediction
Create a new job, provide inline data (e.g., Age = 30, DailyRate = 500), and run the prediction.

Example Inputs for Prediction
Field	Value
Age	30
BusinessTravel	Travel_Rarely
DailyRate	500

Ensure field names and values match the training dataset exactly.
